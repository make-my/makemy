/**
 * This program creates the post page from the html template and post document. It automatically creates a 'posts' folder in the root of the
 * project (or if already exists, uses that one) and creates a folder there with the name of the post. Within this folder will a
 * index.html file be created.
 *
 * The idea of the program is that we take in an HTML-file which serves as a template.
 * The program keeps everything that has been written in the template, and places the files needed on the client side
 * at the end of the <head> tag. Only exception is the init styling for the post. This css file will be placed above
 * the <link> tag containing a css file. This is done so that if user wants, they can style the post-components as they wish in
 * their css file in the template, and because of css's order of precedence will their stylings be used instead of the init-stylings.
 *
 * The program also automatically creates a .json file, containing all the posts in the posts-folder. This .json file
 * can be used to for example create preview components of the posts on the users homepage. This .json file will also be stored in the posts folder,
 * along with the styling.css and client.js file.
