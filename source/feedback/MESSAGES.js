/**
 * Here are all the message used for giving feedback to a user stored.
 * The MESSAGES object works basically like a storage for the different messages.
 * Combined with the 'alertUser'-functions becomes the process of easily alerting the
 * users with custom messages pretty simple.
 *
 * If the message is dynamic (telling that a specific post is already created), then the
 * message must be wrapped in a function with a parameter (i use variable). Then when a
 * dynamic message should be sent, i just have to add an object at the end of alertUser()
 * with the different variables.
 *
 * The functions can also return arrays of messages, in case i want multiple messages to be
 * delivered as feedback.
